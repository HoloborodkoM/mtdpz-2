# List using an array and Linked List Circular
## Description 
This is my implementation of a List using a regulsr array and a Linked List Circular.
All my class methods are covered by unit tests, and the main class files help to visualize how they work.
Also I used Git Action to automatically check the code.

## My variant
My gradebook number is `1110`, so my variant is calculated `1110 % 4 = 2` 

## How to start work

1. If you do not have Node.js, install it. My version `18.9.1` (recommended version is `>18`).  
Can use `nvm` to switch the version. 
2. Clone repository via `git clone https://github.com/HoloborodkoM/mtdpz-lab2.git` 
3. Change directory `cd mtdpz-lab2`
4. Pull up dependencies `npm install`

Check List 
```
node main_list.js
```
Check Linked List
```
node main_linkedlist.js
```
Run tests
```
npm test
```

## Failed test

## Conclusion

Well, to sum it all up, unit testing really made my program more reliable and cleaner code. Compared to console debugging, this is faster and you can immediately see what the error is and where. And using Git Action helped me simplify the work of testing, bringing everything to automatism.
